# <Portfolio>
## Description
This application was created to serve as a portfolio so that future employers can see different projects that have been created throughout the course of the coding journey. This web app served as a challenge to make a web app from scratch. I learned more about the syntax needed to make code run the way that is expected.

When you load the webpage you can see a header with a navigation section that you can click to jump to different sections on the page. Below that, you can find this developer's name, as well as learn a bit more about them. In the works section you can click on an image to be redirected to a different application. You are also able to see responsive layout that adapts to the viewport.
